What is http?

http = hypertext transfer protocol;
It is created in 1997(http 1.1) and later developed in 2015(http 2.0)SPDY protocol.

The user sent the request to server and the server response to the request.

The http is network delay sensitive it senses that if there is less  network delay
the page loads more faster.Then http 2.0 is discovered and the http 2.0 is more faster 
than http 1.1 ,because multiplexing is used.

HTTP 1.1;

1.It works on the textual format;
2.Head of line blocking ,TCP connection blocked all other request until the response 
doesn't receive. all other information related to the header file is repeated in every 
request.
3.It uses request resource inlining for getting multiple pages.
4.It compresses the data by itself.

HTTP 2.0;

1.It works on the binary number.
2.it uses multiplexing so one TCP connection required for multiple requests.
3.it uses PUSH frame for collecting multiple pages like CSS,HTML,Javascript;
4.It uses PHACk for compresses the data.

Objects are important datatypes in Javascript and it more different than the primitive 
data types.Primitive data types are(number, string, boolean,etc......).In primitive data
type it can  hold only one value,but Objects data types can hold many values by key:value 
These are variables called function and methods,every object have some properties,
the properties associated with some values,the values are accessed 
by property names.

for example
var myPhone = new object();
myPhone.name ="oppo";
myPhone.year = 2021;

the values are accessed by the keys;
myPhone.year
output;
2021
